# Windows
This is for all of my Windows AHK scripts that work and do not fail me.
This is for my sanity and for anyone else who wants to understand how ahk works.
This is built for a USB with Portable Apps.
This script will be needed to be put in the same directory as "Start.exe" and you will most likely want to put it into an .exe format.
This script is built to keep all of your computer within an USB and to your customization.
